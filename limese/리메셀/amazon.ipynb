This is the perfect solution for the same which gives enough hydration alongwith being very much light weight.In winters, I apply another Moisturizer on the top of this as this is not sufficient for winters.It has actually improved skin texture and feeling brighter skin which may be because of combined effects of another products too. But this will atleast helps in that.. I am definitely going to buy this again.. And it will last easily for 6 months.. So ultimately it's cost effective too. So overall a good product to stick on.Hope this review helps !\n",
